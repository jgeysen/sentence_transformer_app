Slot machines employ a  reel or video display. Slot machines with reels containing pictures of various fruits are the most popular reel slot machines.

Subject to  these regulations, operators may adjust each slot machine\u2019s payout as a percentage of the amount paid in, payout odds,  wager amounts, and maximum prizes. In general, slot machines have a payout of at least 70% of the amount wagered on a  slot machine over a cycle of 40,000 games. Slot machines are primarily placed in bars, cafes, arcades, and bingo halls. As  of March 31, 2023, we operated 25,579 slot machines in Spain.

The objective of the Spanish version of bingo is to  be the first to complete a five-by-three game card with numbers between one and 90. Cards are sold by bingo hall employees  to players immediately before each draw and there are no intermissions. A caller randomly selects numbers and players fill  the corresponding space on their cards. Players may win a smaller prize by completing a line of five across, a larger prize  by completing all 15 numbers, which is known as \u201cbingo,\u201d or a bonus prize by completing all 15 numbers before a  predetermined amount of numbers is called out. There are also several versions of bonus prizes, which may include  accumulated un-won prizes, online bingo prizes, or linked bingo hall prizes, depending on the Spanish autonomous region.  The cost per game is established by the relevant applicable regional or national regulation, as the case may be, and is  typically \u20ac2, \u20ac3, or \u20ac6.

The key  members of the senior management team, including our chairman, managing directors, chief executive  officer, general manager and legal director, along with our recent additions to the management team who  have a very strong track record, have been in place since our core strategy was implemented in 2006. In April  2022, Mr. Antonio Hostench was appointed as chief executive officer after the board decided to split the  duties of the chief executive officer and the chairman. Mr. Joaquim Agut had served since 2018 as both our  chief executive officer and chairman. Mr. Joaquim Agut now solely acts as executive chairman, directing the  Group\u2019s corporate governance, leadership remuneration, and appointment committees and Mr. Antonio  Hostench oversees our global growth strategy as well as manages our executive leadership team. Further, in  July 2022, Mr. Mois\u00e9s Sanjuan was appointed as Manager of the Casinos Division replacing Mr. Carles Font  who was commissioned to develop various corporate projects and continued to support the Casinos Division  until December 2022. Besides their success in managing the business during the severe economic downturn  in Spain and Italy that started in 2008 and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, our management  team has extensive experience in the Latin American gaming industry, and has developed expertise in  addressing the challenges that may arise in those markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our  management team implemented a fixed cost reduction program resulting in the reduction of headcount and  personnel expenses and reduction in total fixed cost base. A portion of the compensation of our senior  management team in the past had been based on achieving financial targets and certain senior managers have  reinvested a substantial portion of their transaction one-off compensation in connection with the Original  Acquisition in the Group at a parent company level showing their commitment to the business.   We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our business, investing in local people and  communities and upholding the highest responsible gaming standards. Social responsibility is an  integrated strategy of our company, which we believe allows us to become an engine of change and generate  value for all our stakeholders. We have implemented an industry leading and well-established environmental  social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) framework. We are committed to improving safer gambling, reducing the  environmental impact of our business, increasing employee diversity, investing in local people and  communities and upholding the highest corporate governance standards. The first pillar of our ESG  framework is promoting responsible gaming by helping customers prevent gaming addictions through  assistance and guidance rendered by our customer service platforms and establishing artificially intelligent  tools to predict, identify and prevent pathological gambling. We are also training our employees in  responsible gaming and we plan to have 100% of our employees trained by the end of 2023. More than  12,000 of our third-party operations facilities were certified in responsible gaming during 2022 and we plan  to have 90% of our slot route operations facilities certified in responsible gaming by the end of 2024. The  second pillar of our ESG strategy is minimizing our impact on the environment and supporting climate  change initiatives. Our climate resiliency actions pivot around transforming our gaming halls into low impact  and highly efficient buildings, while also reducing our energy and materials consumption. We achieved 45%  reduction in our Scope 2 emissions during 2015-2022 and 66% renewable energy consumption in 2022. Our  aim is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 65% by 2030 compared to 2021 levels and to have 95%  renewable energy consumption by 2030. In addition, we have a firm commitment to equal opportunities,  non-discrimination and respect for diversity, and in 2022, 43% of our employees who hold key management  positions in our casinos are women and our goal is to increase this percentage to over 50% by 2030.  Externally, we support local communities and local initiatives in the countries where we operate, and we  work towards creating strong ties with local businesses and stakeholders. We are also involved in providing  financial support to social initiatives in each country of operation. We have committed to operating in online  regulated markets through local companies, thus ensuring a financial contribution to public resources in the  countries in which those companies operate and in 2022 we contributed approximately \u20ac662 million to such  public resources by payment of corporate gaming taxes in the countries in which we operate. Lastly, as part  of the corporate governance pillar of our ESG framework, we believe in transparency, good governance and  integrity as hallmarks of our organization and we recognize the importance that must be granted to ethics  and compliance and the conduct of our employees both internally and externally. Our business activities are  designed to ensure that each employee strictly complies with the current legislation in every location where  we operate and we intend that by the end of 2023, all of our employees are trained in anti-corruption, money", "pages": ["f4ff5af3-29e9-4967-b597-337592d67aae"]}, {"text": "Our strategic objective is to continue to consolidate our businesses and to achieve sustainable profitable growth  through the following strategic pillars:", "pages": ["f4ff5af3-29e9-4967-b597-337592d67aae"]}, {"text": " Consolidate market leadership position in Spain.

The Spanish slots industry remains fragmented, with more than 6,800 slot machine  operators with less than 100 slot machines based on the Parthenon-EY Report, and we plan to continue to  take advantage of consolidation opportunities. In our B2B business, we have maintained our leadership  position in Spain in a highly competitive market and intend to leverage this position to increase sales in the  slot cabinets and kits and refurbishments segments.    Continue to improve performance of existing and future operations. We will focus on improving the  performance of our existing and future casinos through our \u201cgold mine\u201d strategy. This strategy means that  we seek sustainable and profitable expansion in growing markets, with particular focus on Latin America  and Morocco. The strategy entails identifying an attractive location where we seek to achieve optimum  performance by increased slot machine and gaming table density and expanded hall surface area. If warranted  by the hall\u2019s performance, we may then consider steps such as a further expansion to adjacent premises, a  relocation to larger and better located premises and, ultimately, acquiring or constructing a new casino.  Through the execution of our \u201cgold mine\u201d strategy, since 2010, we have increased the number of slot  machines in our casinos by more than 13,700, expanded the surface area of 182 casinos and opened 124 new  casinos.   Enhance efficiency and productivity programs across businesses and geographies with a resilient cost  structure to address the current inflationary environment. We will seek to build upon the efficiency and  productivity initiatives and synergies achieved in prior periods. We believe that we have achieved over \u20ac50  million of annual savings, which represents a reduction of approximately 7% in our total fixed costs  compared to pro forma fixed costs for the year ended December 31, 2019. We will continue to implement  best practices across our markets to improve efficiency and productivity and seek to maintain or improve our  current EBITDA margins. In our Slots Spain Division, this will entail further enhancing the profitability of  our slot machine portfolio, including opportunistic slot machine rotations and replacements.

The hearing before the Court of Justice of the  European Union took place on January 27, 2022. The judgment, published on September 22, 2022, ruled that the reduction  of compensation to gaming concessionaires cannot be justified only by the need to improve public finances.

For instance, as a  consequence of zoning and environmental legislation, gaming operators are obliged to obtain the relevant licenses from  the local authorities of the city where the activities are carried out, in addition to the gaming sector authorizations described  in this section. On anti-money laundering and terrorism prevention, Spain approved in 2014 a piece of regulation  establishing specific measures related to payment of prizes and due diligence client identity measures in gambling activities.  This regulation implements the Act on anti-money laundering and against financing of terrorism of 2010 and applies to  both traditional and online gaming. On May 20, 2015, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive (EU)  2015/849 of May 20, 2015 modified by Directive (EU) 2018/843 of May 30, 2018 on the prevention of the use of the  financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of  the European Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the  Council and Commission Directive 2006/70/EC. Amongst others, this Directive applies to providers of gambling services.  Member States were required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply  with this Directive 2018/843 by January 10, 2020. According to this Directive, the use of gambling sector services to  launder the proceeds of criminal activity is of concern. In order to mitigate the risks relating to gambling services, it  established the obligation for providers of gambling services posing higher risks to apply customer due diligence measures  for single transactions amounting to \u20ac2,000 or more. Member States should ensure that obliged entities apply the same  threshold to the collection of winnings and wagering of stakes, including by the purchase and exchange of gambling chips,  or both. Spain transposed the Directives 2015/849 and 2018/843 into national law with the approval of the Royal Decree  Law 11/2018, of August 31, 2018 on the transposition of the Directives regarding the preservation of supplementary  pension rights, prevention of money laundering and entry and residence of third-country nationals, and which modifies the  Act 39/2015, of October 1, 2015 of the Common Administrative Procedure of the Public Administrations, and the Royal  Decree Law 7/2021, of April 27, 2021 on the transposition of the Directives of the European Union regarding competition  law, money laundering, credit entities, telecommunications, tributary measures, prevention and restoration of  environmental damages, and posting of workers in the provision of transnational services and consumer protection. The  Royal Decrees set forth the due diligence measures to be implemented by the providers of gambling services (concerning,  among others, the identification of customers and, in particular, the due diligence measures that should be applied when  customers perform transactions amounting to \u20ac2,000 or more in a single operation or in several operations that seem to be  related).

We intend to continue to consolidate our leadership  position in Spain, where we are the market leader in the slots, bingo, sports betting and slot machine  production segments. The Spanish slots industry remains fragmented, with more than 6,800 slot machine  operators with less than 100 slot machines based on the Parthenon-EY Report, and we plan to continue to  take advantage of consolidation opportunities. In our B2B business, we have maintained our leadership  position in Spain in a highly competitive market and intend to leverage this position to increase sales in the  slot cabinets and kits and refurbishments segments.    Continue to improve performance of existing and future operations. We will focus on improving the  performance of our existing and future casinos through our \u201cgold mine\u201d strategy. This strategy means that  we seek sustainable and profitable expansion in growing markets, with particular focus on Latin America  and Morocco. The strategy entails identifying an attractive location where we seek to achieve optimum  performance by increased slot machine and gaming table density and expanded hall surface area. If warranted  by the hall\u2019s performance, we may then consider steps such as a further expansion to adjacent premises, a  relocation to larger and better located premises and, ultimately, acquiring or constructing a new casino.  Through the execution of our \u201cgold mine\u201d strategy, since 2010, we have increased the number of slot  machines in our casinos by more than 13,700, expanded the surface area of 182 casinos and opened 124 new  casinos.   Enhance efficiency and productivity programs across businesses and geographies with a resilient cost  structure to address the current inflationary environment. We will seek to build upon the efficiency and  productivity initiatives and synergies achieved in prior periods. We believe that we have achieved over \u20ac50  million of annual savings, which represents a reduction of approximately 7% in our total fixed costs  compared to pro forma fixed costs for the year ended December 31, 2019. We will continue to implement  best practices across our markets to improve efficiency and productivity and seek to maintain or improve our  current EBITDA margins. In our Slots Spain Division, this will entail further enhancing the profitability of  our slot machine portfolio, including opportunistic slot machine rotations and replacements. In Spain, we are  focused on margin improvement through efficiency programs, which resulted in the discontinuation of  approximately 10% of our slots (resulting in approximately \u20ac6 million of cost savings in fixed taxes per  quarter) and the consequent increase in revenue per machine as compared to pre-pandemic levels for the year  ended December 31, 2019. In Italy, we are focused on optimizing placement of slot machines and VLTs and  achieving favorable terms from our gaming machine suppliers. In our Casinos Division, we intend to  optimize the performance of our casinos through the expansion of our better performing halls and investment  in additional gaming machines, and we have discontinued (closed or sold) 16 gaming halls in Spain since  the start of 2014 and will continue to seek to close underperforming halls in order to improve profitability.", "pages": ["abb9c9f9-a7f5-40c0-a1f3-4547cb276fde"]}, {"text": "We believe we are well-equipped to face the challenges of the current inflationary environment. First, our  cost structure allows us to adapt to an inflationary market. Despite some correlation with inflation, the  evolution of personnel costs has been historically lower than inflation as a result of the productivity plans  and processes we have implemented and we expect such productivity plans and processes to continue to play  a key role in offsetting inflationary impacts on our personnel costs. Further, our variable costs, which mainly  comprise gaming taxes, are largely driven by revenues (typically as a percentage of revenues), and remain  unaffected by inflation. Further, in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, gaming taxes are fixed.  Additionally, the significance of energy costs in our cost structure is very low (below 3% of our total costs)  and energy price increases have a limited impact on our margins. Lastly, our management team has proven  successful in dealing with the inflationary environment experienced in the past in most of the Latin American  countries in which we have operations. Productivity and efficiency gains have been a priority for us as  demonstrated by our increased EBITDA margin on revenues, and we continue to remain committed to  increased margins and productivity.

Inside the gaming hall, we focus on customer value identification and  management, we regularly review the gaming offer and lay-out and use a pricing strategy based on customer  demand. We employ CRM customer segmentation and technology to achieve targets such as visits, frequency  and value, and use customer loyalty and retention programs to improve customer visits and customer  contribution.   Develop our onmichannel strategy across all geographies and focusing on online growth. We intend to  continue to increase both the number of clients and the omnichannel functionalities of our operations in all  of our geographies, especially through digital expansion in our core markets. Our development strategy  includes the use of methods such as a combination of online and offline payment and collection methods,  the possibility of online communication with our customers and new website functionalities. Our goal is to  become the number one operator in Latin America through the implementation of our omnichannel strategy  by leveraging our leadership and experience with the Sportium brand and our properties in Latin America  (online betting, in addition to Spain, is now operating in Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Italy and Panama through  the Sportium brand).   Make selective investments and acquisitions with rigor and focus. Our investment program in the short- to  medium-term is subject to rigorous investment criteria, strategic planning and control of capital expenditures.  We entered into the Sportium Acquisition which enabled us to launch our On-line Gaming & Betting  Division, offering sports betting products through outlets and betting machines in Spain as well as some  betting operations in Colombia, Panama, Peru and more recently in Italy with the acquisition of E-Play24  and in Mexico with the acquisition of GanaBet, both in the third quarter of 2022. See \u201cBusiness\u2014Our  Divisions\u2014On-line Gaming & Betting Division\u201d for further information. We have also pursued selective  acquisitions of attractive slot machine operations which resulted in the addition of approximately 1,000 slots  to our Slots Spain Division during 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. We will continue to review and analyze  investment opportunities in our core business geographies and business segments with a view to executing  investments on an opportunistic basis that enhance our cash flow and positively contribute to EBITDA. We  intend to continue our successful track record of acquisitions, with a particular focus on the acquisition of  gaming operators in Spain and adjacent geographies both to Spain and Latin America, based on our well- defined and disciplined approach. In our acquisitions, we target established, attractive casino businesses in  markets with a relatively stable economic and regulatory environment where we can enhance their operations  and financial performance with our operational expertise.

The unemployment rate, while improving in relative terms, was  reported to be 13.0% and 12.8% in December 2022 and March 2023, respectively. The gross domestic product has been  growing at a rate of 2.5% in 2018 and 1.8% in 2019, then declined by 10.8% in 2020, and returned to positive 5.5% in each  of 2021 and 2022. The economic downturn has had a number of negative impacts on our operations in Spain. For example,  the aggregate number of visitors to our slots arcades and casino and gaming halls in Spain as well as their average visit  length and amount wagered decreased commencing in 2009, and, while increasing in recent years, have not yet recovered  to the pre-downturn levels. The economic downturn in Spain and the effects of the credit crisis also adversely impacted the  availability and cost of our bank financing in Spain. While the Spanish economy has been experiencing a modest recovery  in recent years, continued concerns about the political uncertainty, unemployment and the availability and cost of credit,  together with the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, pose risks for the full recovery of the Spanish economy.

In these markets, we are often exposed to substantial  political, economic and currency risks because the governments, economies and currencies of many of these countries are  more volatile than the countries of the European Union. Recent developments in global commodities markets (in particular  with respect to oil) and slowing Chinese demand for unfinished goods from the region has significantly impacted the local  economies in Latin America. In the past, governments in Latin America have frequently intervened in the economies of  their respective countries and have occasionally made significant changes in policy and regulations as a result of political  changes or economic declines. For example, a new tax reform bill was approved in Colombia in December 2022 as Law  2277 of 2022. The tax reform provides, among other things: (i) that wealth tax is applicable to Colombian individuals and  non-residents in respect of assets held in Colombia, (ii) for an increase in the dividend tax rate for local and foreign  shareholders, (iii) for an increase in the long-term capital gains tax rate (increasing from 10% in 2022 to 15% in 2023); (iv)  for the elimination and the limitation of specific tax benefits and exemptions, such as the rule that exempted the taxing of  capital gains from the sale of publicly listed shares (currently applicable to sales of less than 10% of the total shares in  circulation, which would be limited to 3% of the total shares in circulation as from 2023) and (v) the introduction of a  minimum tax based on an effective tax rate determined over adjusted accounting profits. Previously, in September 2021,  the Colombian Congress approved the Law 2155 of 2021 by means of which a new Colombian tax reform was enacted,  which entailed (i) an increase in the corporate income tax rate from 31% to 35%, and (ii) the possibility to treat only 50%  of the industry and commerce municipal tax as discount for purposes of the corporate income tax (previously, 100%).

Upon the expiration of a license, a regulator could decide that in the future a given license will be available  to multiple licensees, even if the previous license was exclusively granted to only one licensee. Renewing a license can be  costly and time consuming, and our current license may not be renewed upon its expiration on favorable terms or at all.  For example, the 2018 Italian Stability Law called for Italy\u2019s 210 existing bingo concessions to be reviewed by the ADM  throughout the year and to be awarded by means of a public tender process, which renewal process could adversely impact  our Italian gaming hall joint venture. Similarly, the license renewal process for approximately eight of our gaming halls in  Mexico was significantly delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, some regions of Spain have imposed  restrictions or limitations on the renewal of the gaming licenses. For example, several regulations have imposed restrictions  on the minimum distances that gaming halls locations should maintain, inter alia, from educational establishments in the  respective cities, or from other gaming halls, gaming halls or gaming arcades, which may condition or limit the renewal of  the corresponding licenses (for example, (i) in the Region of Valencia, the recently passed new Law 1/2020, of June 11,  2020 of the Generalitat on the regulation of gambling and the prevention of pathological gambling, prohibits the renewal  of licenses for premises where gambling activities are carried out within 850 meters of an educational institution or 500  meters of another gaming premises; (ii) in the Principality of Asturias, the recently passed new Decree 5/2021, of February  12, 2021, provides restrictions and criteria governing the granting of authorizations for gaming and betting which restrict  and, in some cases, prohibit the renewal of licenses for premises where gambling activities are carried out within 100  meters of an educational institution; and (iii) in the region of Andalusia, the recently passed new regional Decree 161/2021  of May 11, 2021 which prevents the granting of new gaming licenses for premises where gambling activities are carried  out within 150 meters of an educational institution or 100 meters of another gaming premises). More generally, any failure  to renew or obtain any material licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations and  financial condition. Furthermore, our licenses are subject to revocation upon the occurrence of certain events, which are  different for each license. Under certain circumstances, a license could be revoked if determined to be against the public  interest or, for example in Panama, upon a change of control. For example, our license may be revoked if we fail to pay  the applicable fees to the regulatory authority or, in certain cases, if we fail to communicate to the regulatory authority  certain changes in our corporate structure. Under several of our licenses the transfer of the ownership of the license  agreement is prohibited or restricted.

Therefore, maximizing liquidity has been one of the primary  objectives of the Group since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Further, in November 2022, we issued  the 10.375% 2027 Notes, the proceeds of which were used to redeem an additional portion of the outstanding  amount of the 2023 Notes. Separately, several other credit lines with financial institutions have also been  renewed and increased, providing the Group with additional liquidity when necessary, including extension  of the maturity and increasing the size of the Revolving Credit Facility in August 2022.   Personnel expenses: The Group made labor costs more flexible during 2020 through temporary labor force  adjustment plans, mainly in Spain and Italy (in Spain, referred to as ERTE (expediente de regulaci\u00f3n  temporal de empleo) and in Italy, referred to as CIGO/CIGD/FIS (trattamenti di integrazione salariale con  causale COVID-19)), that allowed businesses to suspend employment contracts or reduce staff hours due to  and during force majeure circumstances, while applying for the state to pay a portion of employee wages.

We are a leader in Spanish slot machine operations and  manufacturing, as well as casino and gaming hall operations. We are also a leader in gaming operations in  Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Peru. We believe that this leadership position  enables us to identify and manage trends in the private gaming industry in Spain and Latin America. The  Spanish slot machine operations and bingo segments are highly fragmented, as are the Latin American  gaming markets, and we are substantially larger than our competitors. We believe that our size allows us to  benefit from economies of scale in many of our businesses. For example, in our slot machine operations, we  can spread the cost of providing coin collection services and rapid response to repair calls (minimizing  machine downtime) over our 40,683 slot machines in Spain as of March 31, 2023, which helps us to realize  a lower operational cost per machine and to have a more developed internal control system as compared to  our competitors. We also believe that due to our size and resources, we are well-positioned to acquire  attractive gaming operations as consolidation opportunities arise in the markets in which we operate. We  believe that we are larger in terms of size and have more resources compared to the majority of our competitors. From a business division perspective, we are a well-diversified gaming company with four  distinct and complementary business units within the industry (Casinos, Slots Spain, Slots Italy and On-line  Gaming & Betting) and operations in eight countries outside of Spain. We believe that the diversity of our  revenue streams helps us improve the stability of our cash flow profile by reducing our dependence on any  single geographic market, economy or business segment in the gaming industry. While we focus our  international expansion in markets with growth potential, we favor markets with a relatively stable economic  and regulatory environment, and, in particular, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, 91.2% of our  EBITDA was generated in countries that currently have an investment grade rating from S&P and Moody\u2019s.  Within Spain, there are 17 different autonomous regions with separate regulatory regimes as laid out in the  Spanish constitution, reinforcing the geographical and regulatory diversification of our business. Since 2010,  our expansion in Latin America has concentrated in Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the Dominican Republic  and Mexico and we have also made substantial investments in our Panama business.    The multichannel and local gaming model ensures a resilient, wide and loyal customer base, detached  from international travel. By running a multichannel operating and local gaming business model, we have  been able to create a resilient, wide, local and loyal customer base. We operate through three main channels:  (i) our own points of sale (\u201cPoS\u201d), (ii) third party PoS and (iii) online gaming. Our own PoS are mainly  casinos, bingos and arcades and we generally rent the facilities from third party landlords. Third party PoS  correspond mainly to bars and in some cases gaming halls where we place our slot machines and sports  betting terminals. In both our own PoS as well as third party PoS, we typically enter into long term contracts  under which we pay rent or share a portion of the revenue of the operation. We also own the gaming license  and fully run the operation. We have achieved significant online growth, primarily through online sports  betting, casino and poker. Our multichannel business model provides resilience to our earnings, as was  demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, as our online business unit demonstrated strong performance  despite the closure of physical points of sales. Unlike other gaming operators, our customer base is not  dependent on tourism as our typical customer lives within a few kilometers of our PoS and visits us on a  regular basis for leisure. Our typical client is a recurrent customer who plays various times per month.  Therefore, the recovery of our business after the COVID-19 pandemic was primarily driven by the opening  hours and capacity allowed by local regulatory bodies rather than by the international travel restrictions  imposed by the different governments.   High barriers to entry in a highly regulated industry. We believe that there are significant barriers to entry  in our principal business divisions, including regulatory, financial and technological barriers, the need for  operational expertise and the need for a proven track record in order to obtain the trust and confidence of  regulators, customers, partners, site owners and gaming machine and other suppliers. For our casinos in  Panama, casino licenses are granted in relation to a geographic area and for long periods of time. In our Slots  Spain Division, we typically enter into five-year agreements to place our slot machines in a given location,  and many of these agreements have been consistently renewed for the past twenty years. Additionally, in the  B2B business and in our Slots Spain Division, we believe a new competitor would need significant financial  resources, operating expertise and a qualified workforce to build profitable operations. We believe that  barriers to entry in our principal business divisions, including advertising bans in Spain, as well as the need  for a strong retail business in order to gain a significant foothold in those countries\u2019 gaming markets, help  protect our leading market position and profitability by limiting the number of new competitors in our core  business segments. A key strategic focus of our business is to continue to increase our market position  through our multichannel model, including our online business and our well-established physical footprint.   Developing a strong online business by leveraging our established physical footprint. We benefit from a  multichannel business model that enables us to cross-sell gaming and betting products between retail and  online customers, and increases brand awareness in geographies with restricted gaming advertising. Since  the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully grown and strengthened our online operations.  In Spain, our largest market in terms of revenues and EBITDA, the EBITDA for our On-line Gaming and  Betting division grew by 55.7% from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended  March 31, 2023 from \u20ac10.4 million to \u20ac16.1 million, representing 8.8% and 10.7% of our EBITDA for the  three months ended March 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2023, respectively. Our online  footprint has been increasingly reinforced with the acquisition of online gaming platforms such as E-Play24  and GanaBet, both in the third quarter of 2022. Our multichannel approach, which includes growing the  online channel in a financially responsible manner, has proven accretive and is expected to be a core part of  our strategy in the coming years.  Significant positive free cash flow generation with a lower cost base. The adverse effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic required us to sharpen our cost and capital expenditure controls, as our primary financial focus  turned to free cash flow generation. We reduced our cost base and capital expenditures with a clear focus on  fixed operating expenses and we have been able to maintain such cost reduction measures after returning to  4 pre-pandemic levels of activity. We expect that over \u20ac50 million of annual savings will be sustained in the  long-term. Our cost reduction plan is mainly driven by (i) optimizing our fixed taxes through an optimization  of the slot machines pool by discontinuing approximately 10% of our slots which were less productive, and  the consequent increase in revenue per machine as compared to pre-pandemic levels for the year ended  December 31, 2019; (ii) an improvement in personnel cost efficiency in Latin America and the optimization  of our commercial and technical services routes and (iii) a renegotiation of our lease agreements that resulted  in a reduction in our operational leases. We believe that the implementation of these cost-efficiency measures  will enhance profitability going forward and improve our EBITDA margins. Free cash flow generation  remains a key priority for our management team, and they aim to ensure that capital expenditure plans allow  for significant cash flow generation and that investments are approved based on a short payback period  hurdle.   Seasoned Management Team. We are led by an experienced and professional management team with a  track record of managing complex operations, developing new products inside and outside the gaming  industry, delivering upon its commitments and managing through challenging business environments. The  key members of the senior management team, including our chairman, managing directors, chief executive  officer, general manager and legal director, along with our recent additions to the management team who  have a very strong track record, have been in place since our core strategy was implemented in 2006. In April  2022, Mr. Antonio Hostench was appointed as chief executive officer after the board decided to split the  duties of the chief executive officer and the chairman. Mr. Joaquim Agut had served since 2018 as both our  chief executive officer and chairman. Mr. Joaquim Agut now solely acts as executive chairman, directing  the Group\u2019s corporate governance, leadership remuneration, and appointment committees and Mr. Antonio  Hostench oversees our global growth strategy as well as manages our executive leadership team. Further, in  July 2022, Mr. Mois\u00e9s Sanjuan was appointed as Manager of the Casinos Division replacing Mr. Carles Font  who was commissioned to develop various corporate projects and continued to support the Casinos Division  until December 2022. Besides their success in managing the business during the severe economic downturn  in Spain and Italy that started in 2008 and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, our management  team has extensive experience in the Latin American gaming industry, and has developed expertise in  addressing the challenges that may arise in those markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our  management team implemented a fixed cost reduction program resulting in the reduction of headcount and  personnel expenses and reduction in total fixed cost base. A portion of the compensation of our senior  management team in the past had been based on achieving financial targets and certain senior managers have  reinvested a substantial portion of their transaction one-off compensation in connection with the Original  Acquisition in the Group at a parent company level showing their commitment to the business.   We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our business, investing in local people and  communities and upholding the highest responsible gaming standards. Social responsibility is an  integrated strategy of our company, which we believe allows us to become an engine of change and generate  value for all our stakeholders. We have implemented an industry leading and well-established environmental  social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) framework. We are committed to improving safer gambling, reducing the  environmental impact of our business, increasing employee diversity, investing in local people and  communities and upholding the highest corporate governance standards. The first pillar of our ESG  framework is promoting responsible gaming by helping customers prevent gaming addictions through  assistance and guidance rendered by our customer service platforms and establishing artificially intelligent  tools to predict, identify and prevent pathological gambling. We are also training our employees in  responsible gaming and we plan to have 100% of our employees trained by the end of 2023. More than  12,000 of our third-party operations facilities were certified in responsible gaming during 2022 and we plan  to have 90% of our slot route operations facilities certified in responsible gaming by the end of 2024. The  second pillar of our ESG strategy is minimizing our impact on the environment and supporting climate  change initiatives. Our climate resiliency actions pivot around transforming our gaming halls into low impact  and highly efficient buildings, while also reducing our energy and materials consumption. We achieved 45%  reduction in our Scope 2 emissions during 2015-2022 and 66% renewable energy consumption in 2022. Our  aim is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 65% by 2030 compared to 2021 levels and to have 95%  renewable energy consumption by 2030. In addition, we have a firm commitment to equal opportunities,  non-discrimination and respect for diversity, and in 2022, 43% of our employees who hold key management  positions in our casinos are women and our goal is to increase this percentage to over 50% by 2030.  Externally, we support local communities and local initiatives in the countries where we operate, and we  work towards creating strong ties with local businesses and stakeholders. We are also involved in providing  financial support to social initiatives in each country of operation. We have committed to operating in online  regulated markets through local companies, thus ensuring a financial contribution to public resources in the  countries in which those companies operate and in 2022 we contributed approximately \u20ac662 million to such  public resources by payment of corporate gaming taxes in the countries in which we operate. Lastly, as part  of the corporate governance pillar of our ESG framework, we believe in transparency, good governance and integrity as hallmarks of our organization and we recognize the importance that must be granted to ethics  and compliance and the conduct of our employees both internally and externally. Our business activities are  designed to ensure that each employee strictly complies with the current legislation in every location where  we operate and we intend that by the end of 2023, all of our employees are trained in anti-corruption, money  laundering and other regulatory compliance policies and corporate guidelines in accordance with our annual  training plans.", "pages": ["08641432-7af5-46c8-a624-d36d4b549584", "ae7ef8ba-def1-407b-b91a-1049bffdfd1a", "34c458f4-3d8a-4375-9288-2d9e600dd308", "abb9c9f9-a7f5-40c0-a1f3-4547cb276fde"]}, {"text": "(1) \u201cBlackstone\u201d refers to, individually or collectively, any investment fund, co-investment vehicles and/or other similar vehicles or accounts, in each  case managed or advised by an affiliate of Blackstone Inc., or any of their respective successors.

This right to withdraw is also recognized to the shareholders of the parent company of a group  legally required to prepare consolidated annual accounts, if the general meeting of shareholders of such parent company  does not resolve to distribute at least 25% of the consolidated profits attributable to the parent company obtained during  the previous financial year, provided that they can be legally distributed and that profits attributable to the parent company  have been obtained during the previous three financial years.

As a consequence,  holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of  the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide  instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if enforcement of any security interest in Spain was to be carried out by the Security Agent, it may be necessary (i) that each of the secured parties  benefiting from such Collateral proves its title to the secured obligations, ratifies such Collateral and accepts the benefit of  the security interest in its respective names and (ii) to prove that the Security Agent is duly and expressly empowered by  means of duly notarized powers of attorney granted in favor of the Security Agent by each of the actual or future creditors,  if necessary, with the Apostille of The Hague Convention dated October 5, 1961. Therefore, there could be a delay in the  enforcement of the Collateral in Spain while the Security Agent obtains such powers and the relevant public deeds are  granted. In the absence of the notarized and apostilled powers of attorney, the Security Agent may not be able to enforce  the relevant Collateral or security interests in Spain on behalf of the holders of the Notes, and there is a risk that the Security  Agent would only be able to enforce the security interest against the debt that it individually holds, and not for the full  amount owed to creditors for whom it may be acting as Security Agent. Further, those beneficial holders of the security  who have not accepted the security or duly empowered (by means of notarial and apostilled powers of attorney) the Security  Agent to do so may be treated, from a Spanish law perspective including without limitation in an insolvency scenario, as  unsecured creditors.

We are a leader in Spanish slot machine operations and  manufacturing, as well as casino and gaming hall operations. We are also a leader in gaming operations in  Panama, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Peru. We believe that this leadership position  enables us to identify and manage trends in the private gaming industry in Spain and Latin America. The  Spanish slot machine operations and bingo segments are highly fragmented, as are the Latin American  gaming markets, and we are substantially larger than our competitors. We believe that our size allows us to  benefit from economies of scale in many of our businesses. For example, in our slot machine operations, we  can spread the cost of providing coin collection services and rapid response to repair calls (minimizing  machine downtime) over our 40,683 slot machines in Spain as of March 31, 2023, which helps us to realize  a lower operational cost per machine and to have a more developed internal control system as compared to  our competitors. We also believe that due to our size and resources, we are well-positioned to acquire  attractive gaming operations as consolidation opportunities arise in the markets in which we operate. We  believe that we are larger in terms of size and have more resources compared to the majority of our  competitors. From a business division perspective, we are a well-diversified gaming company with four  distinct and complementary business units within the industry (Casinos, Slots Spain, Slots Italy and On-line  Gaming & Betting) and operations in eight countries outside of Spain. We believe that the diversity of our  revenue streams helps us improve the stability of our cash flow profile by reducing our dependence on any  single geographic market, economy or business segment in the gaming industry. While we focus our  international expansion in markets with growth potential, we favor markets with a relatively stable economic  and regulatory environment, and, in particular, for the three months ended March 31, 2023, 91.2% of our  EBITDA was generated in countries that currently have an investment grade rating from S&P and Moody\u2019s.  Within Spain, there are 17 different autonomous regions with separate regulatory regimes as laid out in the  Spanish constitution, reinforcing the geographical and regulatory diversification of our business. Since 2010,  our expansion in Latin America has concentrated in Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Mexico and we have also made substantial investments in our Panama business.    The multichannel and local gaming model ensures a resilient, wide and loyal customer base, detached  from international travel. By running a multichannel operating and local gaming business model, we have  been able to create a resilient, wide, local and loyal customer base. We operate through three main channels:  (i) our own points of sale (\u201cPoS\u201d), (ii) third party PoS and (iii) online gaming. Our own PoS are mainly  casinos, bingos and arcades and we generally rent the facilities from third party landlords. Third party PoS  correspond mainly to bars and in some cases gaming halls where we place our slot machines and sports  betting terminals. In both our own PoS as well as third party PoS, we typically enter into long term contracts  under which we pay rent or share a portion of the revenue of the operation. We also own the gaming license  and fully run the operation. We have achieved significant online growth, primarily through online sports  betting, casino and poker. Our multichannel business model provides resilience to our earnings, as was  demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, as our online business unit demonstrated strong performance  despite the closure of physical points of sales. Unlike other gaming operators, our customer base is not  dependent on tourism as our typical customer lives within a few kilometers of our PoS and visits us on a  regular basis for leisure. Our typical client is a recurrent customer who plays various times per month.  Therefore, the recovery of our business after the COVID-19 pandemic was primarily driven by the opening  hours and capacity allowed by local regulatory bodies rather than by the international travel restrictions  imposed by the different governments.   High barriers to entry in a highly regulated industry. We believe that there are significant barriers to entry  in our principal business divisions, including regulatory, financial and technological barriers, the need for  operational expertise and the need for a proven track record in order to obtain the trust and confidence of  regulators, customers, partners, site owners and gaming machine and other suppliers. For our casinos in  Panama, casino licenses are granted in relation to a geographic area and for long periods of time. In our Slots  Spain Division, we typically enter into five-year agreements to place our slot machines in a given location,  and many of these agreements have been consistently renewed for the past twenty years. Additionally, in the  B2B business and in our Slots Spain Division, we believe a new competitor would need significant financial  resources, operating expertise and a qualified workforce to build profitable operations. We believe that  barriers to entry in our principal business divisions, including advertising bans in Spain, as well as the need  for a strong retail business in order to gain a significant foothold in those countries\u2019 gaming markets, help  protect our leading market position and profitability by limiting the number of new competitors in our core  business segments. A key strategic focus of our business is to continue to increase our market position  through our multichannel model, including our online business and our well-established physical footprint.   Developing a strong online business by leveraging our established physical footprint. We benefit from a  multichannel business model that enables us to cross-sell gaming and betting products between retail and  online customers, and increases brand awareness in geographies with restricted gaming advertising. Since  the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully grown and strengthened our online operations.  In Spain, our largest market in terms of revenues and EBITDA, the EBITDA for our On-line Gaming and  Betting division grew by 55.7% from the three months ended March 31, 2022 to the three months ended  March 31, 2023 from \u20ac10.4 million to \u20ac16.1 million, representing 8.8% and 10.7% of our EBITDA for the  three months ended March 31, 2022 and the three months ended March 31, 2023, respectively. Our online  footprint has been increasingly reinforced with the acquisition of online gaming platforms such as E-Play24  and GanaBet, both in the third quarter of 2022. Our multichannel approach, which includes growing the  online channel in a financially responsible manner, has proven accretive and is expected to be a core part of  our strategy in the coming years.  Significant positive free cash flow generation with a lower cost base. The adverse effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic required us to sharpen our cost and capital expenditure controls, as our primary financial focus  turned to free cash flow generation. We reduced our cost base and capital expenditures with a clear focus on  fixed operating expenses and we have been able to maintain such cost reduction measures after returning to  pre-pandemic levels of activity. We expect that over \u20ac50 million of annual savings will be sustained in the  long-term. Our cost reduction plan is mainly driven by (i) optimizing our fixed taxes through an optimization  of the slot machines pool by discontinuing approximately 10% of our slots which were less productive, and  the consequent increase in revenue per machine as compared to pre-pandemic levels for the year ended  December 31, 2019; (ii) an improvement in personnel cost efficiency in Latin America and the optimization  of our commercial and technical services routes and (iii) a renegotiation of our lease agreements that resulted  in a reduction in our operational leases. We believe that the implementation of these cost-efficiency measures  will enhance profitability going forward and improve our EBITDA margins. Free cash flow generation  remains a key priority for our management team, and they aim to ensure that capital expenditure plans allow  for significant cash flow generation and that investments are approved based on a short payback period  hurdle.", "pages": ["9218f5eb-72f0-490e-a676-9b68341c9b74", "0b28daab-7254-4158-8ec2-70d03df1de53"]}, {"text": "We believe we are well-equipped to face the challenges of the current inflationary environment. First, our  cost structure allows us to adapt to an inflationary market. Despite some correlation with inflation, the  evolution of personnel costs has been historically lower than inflation as a result of the productivity plans  and processes we have implemented and we expect such productivity plans and processes to continue to play  a key role in offsetting inflationary impacts on our personnel costs. Further, our variable costs, which mainly  comprise gaming taxes, are largely driven by revenues (typically as a percentage of revenues), and remain  unaffected by inflation. Further, in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, gaming taxes are fixed.  Additionally, the significance of energy costs in our cost structure is very low (below 3% of our total costs)  and energy price increases have a limited impact on our margins. Lastly, our management team has proven  successful in dealing with the inflationary environment experienced in the past in most of the Latin American  countries in which we have operations. Productivity and efficiency gains have been a priority for us as  demonstrated by our increased EBITDA margin on revenues, and we continue to remain committed to  increased margins and productivity. Therefore, we believe that we have the capacity to manage our costs in  a high inflationary environment and to manage the impact of inflation and maintain our margins.    Continue proactive marketing and sales approach. We will continue to develop and implement our  proactive and customer-oriented marketing and sales approach, which has been added to our traditional  product-oriented approach. Our marketing and sales strategy can be summarized as \u201clooking for customers  rather than waiting for them.\u201d Our approach, which is supported by in-house commercial IT tools and  applications, includes targeted marketing and network-oriented data collection to identify, attract and retain  specific clients and client profiles. Inside the gaming hall, we focus on customer value identification and  management, we regularly review the gaming offer and lay-out and use a pricing strategy based on customer  demand. We employ CRM customer segmentation and technology to achieve targets such as visits, frequency  and value, and use customer loyalty and retention programs to improve customer visits and customer  contribution.   Develop our onmichannel strategy across all geographies and focusing on online growth. We intend to continue to increase both the number of clients and the omnichannel functionalities of our operations in all  of our geographies, especially through digital expansion in our core markets. Our development strategy  includes the use of methods such as a combination of online and offline payment and collection methods, the  possibility of online communication with our customers and new website functionalities. Our goal is to  become the number one operator in Latin America through the implementation of our omnichannel strategy  by leveraging our leadership and experience with the Sportium brand and our properties in Latin America  (online betting, in addition to Spain, is now operating in Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Italy and Panama through  the Sportium brand).   Make selective investments and acquisitions with rigor and focus. Our investment program in the short- to  medium-term is subject to rigorous investment criteria, strategic planning and control of capital expenditures.  We entered into the Sportium Acquisition which enabled us to launch our On-line Gaming & Betting  Division, offering sports betting products through outlets and betting machines in Spain as well as some  betting operations in Colombia, Panama, Peru and more recently in Italy with the acquisition of E-Play24  and in Mexico with the acquisition of GanaBet, both in the third quarter of 2022. See \u201cBusiness\u2014Our  Divisions\u2014On-line Gaming & Betting Division\u201d for further information. We have also pursued selective  acquisitions of attractive slot machine operations which resulted in the addition of approximately 1,000 slots  to our Slots Spain Division during 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. We will continue to review and analyze  investment opportunities in our core business geographies and business segments with a view to executing  investments on an opportunistic basis that enhance our cash flow and positively contribute to EBITDA. We  intend to continue our successful track record of acquisitions, with a particular focus on the acquisition of  gaming operators in Spain and adjacent geographies both to Spain and Latin America, based on our well- defined and disciplined approach. In our acquisitions, we target established, attractive casino businesses in  markets with a relatively stable economic and regulatory environment where we can enhance their operations  and financial performance with our operational expertise. We are also focusing on extending our online  operations and we have recently acquired two online operators for our On-line Gaming & Betting Division.", "pages": ["c9ee393e-956a-4933-88eb-f0ef92311115", "0c8cef39-f9ac-48ca-bb30-1d7a16f65dda"]}, {"text": " Casino La Hispaniola is located in the Hispaniola Hotel & Casino in Santo Domingo, the capital of the  Dominican Republic.

Therefore, in Spain, traditional gaming is generally regulated at a regional level, and the national legislation applies where  no regional legislation exists, but it does not regulate a specific gambling activity or when the gambling activity affects  more than one Region. At present, most of the Regions have passed extensive legislation governing traditional private  gaming, including the granting of the relevant operating licenses and authorizations, tax measures and the monitoring of  each type of private game. Additionally, the Regions can regulate the public traditional gaming market (lotteries) within  their own territorial areas. Regulation of the traditional private gaming market is similar across each of the Regions.

The requirements for obtaining approval from the regional authority to operate a gaming hall include local authorization to  open the gaming hall premises, filing certain documents with the regional authority, such as a list of employees, and  complying with an on-site inspection of the gaming hall premises. The authorization for operation of the gaming hall varies  in duration from three to ten years depending on the Region, generally with automatic extensions for the same periods of  time, on the terms established in the relevant regional laws and regulations.

Debt against the insolvency estate  includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) certain costs and expenses of the  insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the debtor under reciprocal  contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after the insolvency of the debtor is declared  (including the amounts payable as a consequence of the breach of contract by the insolvent debtor if such  breach takes place after the declaration of its insolvency), (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw- back action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the debtor and correspond to a refund of  consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations  created by law or from the non-contractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of  insolvency and until its conclusion (or from the non-contractual liability before the declaration of insolvency  due to death or personal damages), (vi) in case of liquidation, the credits granted to the bankrupt before the  opening of the liquidation phase, to finance compliance with the viability plan (plan de viabilidad) to support  the composition agreement, including claims granted by \u201cspecially related parties\u201d to the debtor if the  maximum claims and the details of the relevant creditor are included in the composition agreement, and (viii)  in case of subsequent insolvency, 50% of the amount of credits arising from internal financing or new  financing granted within the framework of a court-sanctioned restructuring plan, provided that such plan  affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is provided  by specially related parties, after deducting their claims). These claims are preferred to all others except  for specially privileged claims specifically with regard to the assets (collateral) subject to the relevant  security interest or special privilege. Estate claims are not subject to ranking or acknowledgement and,  in principle, must be paid as and when they fall due.   Insolvency Claims (cr\u00e9ditos concursales). Insolvency claims are classified as follows:  \u2013 Specially Privileged Claims (cr\u00e9ditos con privilegio especial): Creditors benefiting from special  privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of  their security (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured  asset minus those claims that hold higher ranking security over such asset). The part of the claim  exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims  benefiting from special privileges may entail separate enforcement proceedings, though subject to  certain restrictions derived from a waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional  limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Act. As a general rule, privileged creditors are not subject  to the composition agreement unless they give their express support by voluntarily acceding to the  composition agreement and if certain majorities have been reached among privileged creditors (see \u201c\u2014 Conclusion of insolvency\u2014Settlement\u201d). In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment  against the assets on which they are secured up to the value of the security. However, the administrator  has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses  under specific payment rules.  \u2013 Generally Privileged Claims (cr\u00e9ditos con privilegio general): Creditors benefiting from a general  privilege, including, among others, specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities  or authorities are recognized for half their amount, and claims held by the creditor taking the initiative  to apply for the insolvency proceedings, for up to 50% of the amount of such debt (except if they rank  as subordinated claims). New funds under a court-sanctioned restructuring plan in the amount not  admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (cr\u00e9dito contra la masa) are also credits with general  privileges provided that such plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is provided by specially related parties, after deducting their claims). As  a general rule and except as set forth below (see \u201c\u2014Conclusion of insolvency\u2014Settlement\u201d), the holders  of general privileges will be affected by the composition agreement only if they have been authors of  the proposal or if they have adhered to it, unless they have revoked the adhesion, as well as if they  adhere to the agreement in a form already accepted by the creditors or approved by the judge before the  judicial declaration of compliance.  \u2013 Ordinary Claims (cr\u00e9ditos ordinarios) Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims)  are paid pro rata once estate claims and privileged claims have been paid.  \u2013 Subordinated Claims (cr\u00e9ditos subordinados): Subordinated claims are classified contractually or  pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties  in special relationships with the debtor. In the case of a legal entity, this includes directors (whether  duly appointed or \u201cde facto\u201d acting as such \u2014administradores de hecho) and those holding general  powers of attorney (including those that have held such positions during the two years prior to the  insolvency declaration), group companies pertaining and their common shareholders, and any  shareholders holding over 5% (for listed companies) or 10% (for non-listed companies) of the entity\u2019s  share capital. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their  credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a restructuring plan entered into in compliance  with the Spanish Insolvency Act shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the  debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such  restructuring plan.
